# Algorithm-Efficiency-Analyzer-Tool

This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to visualize the performance of various sorting algorithms on randomly generated or user-defined arrays of numbers.

Features

Supports multiple sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.
Users can input numbers manually or use randomly generated numbers for sorting.
Provides visualization of sorting algorithm performance through a bar chart, displaying execution times in seconds.
Additional information displayed includes the median of the sorted array and the kth smallest element after sorting.
Customizable plot parameters such as colors, bar width, opacity, and bar spacing.
Algorithm selection feature allows users to choose which sorting algorithms to include in the visualization.
Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Libraries
tkinter: Used for building the GUI.
matplotlib: Used for plotting the visualization.
Run the application:
Copy code
python GUI.py
Use the GUI interface to select sorting algorithms, input array size and numbers, and initiate visualization.
